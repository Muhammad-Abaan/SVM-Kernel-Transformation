# Support Vector Machine Kernel Transformation

This repository provides a hands-on implementation of **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** with kernel transformations, showcasing how kernel tricks enable us to handle non-linear data in both classification and regression tasks.

## Contents
- `SVM Kernel Implementation.ipynb` → Main notebook with code, visualizations, and explanations.
